# Debugging Quantum Programs (Example)

The Q# code in this task implements Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for two example functions (one constant and one balanced). It contains exactly **8 bugs**, ranging from issues that will manifest as compilation errors to problems that will require running the fixed algorithm and analyzing its output.
